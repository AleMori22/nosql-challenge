In the **Starter_Code** directory youâ€™ll find:
The **Resources** folder holding the **establishments.json** containing the data necessary for the analysis. 
The **NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb** file that will import the data stored in the **establishments.json**, lode it in a Mongo database and update it by adding a new instance for the restaurant called Penang Flavours, deleting all the instance presenting Dover as a Local Authority and dimensioning latitude and longitude as decimal numbers as well as setting the RatingValues fields as integer.
The **NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb** file that will execute the analysis required by the food magazine Eat Safe, Love.
All the code is made by me with the help of the class activities and resources.
